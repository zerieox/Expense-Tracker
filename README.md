# Expense Tracker

*Built by a broke college kid* 

## About the site
Often times, college students tend to eat out to save time or are just not very good at tracking what they spend on a daily basis, and especially with the ease of online accessibility make purchases on the go. This expense tracker is a simple way to keep track of the spendings that many people do without having to login to their bank accounts every single time. Users are able
to log their sources of incomes whether it be from stocks, salary, or any other sources and in addition expenses like groceries or education cost. The data will then be displayed in a graph to summarize the spendings the users made over the past couple days.  

## Future Plan
